# Freelancer Homepage Vue.Js Application Example

A work-in-progress by @gbezyuk.

The repo contains both the frontend app (based on vue-hackernews-2.0), and the backend/API/admin app built with Django.
Currently backend API provides just a single snapshot, which is prefetched during SSR,
with no additional requests performing on the client side. Hovewer, the architecture implements a fully-functional Vuex.

See repository tags / releases for example history.
